Bugs and problems in omnibook module code
=========================================

* You can use /proc/apm emulation for battery status monitoring only.
* Volume Control buttons do not generate scancodes on XE3GC style models.
  Scancode emulation needs intensive testing to be reliable.
* Volume Control buttons on machine (not on docking station) do not generate
  scancodes on OB500 style models. It is unhandled yet.
* Sometimes (I assume when the embedded controller is busy) the procfs
  interface displays fake values.
* Setting the LCD brightness on HP OmniBook XE3 GF via /proc/omnibook/lcd
  is working if you press one of the brightness control keys once after
  writing the value into /proc/omnibook/lcd.
* After reenable the touchpad via /proc/omnibook/touchpad you may restart
  X / gpm.
* I'm not a native English speaker so text corrections are welcome.

Problems with OmniBook machines running Linux
=============================================

* If you use APM there are a lot of mysterious hangs at suspend/resume on
  the new models. The OmniBooks use ACPI not APM but ACPI for Linux does not
  provide reliable power management functions yet. Use swsusp instead.
* In some cases the touchpad in XE3 GF models can freeze the laptop after
  disabling and reenabling it with the disable button and doing a tap
  action when neither gpm nor X is running. It seems to be a BIOS or
  firmware bug.
  Please report if you can reproduce it.
* On XE3 GC models Fn-s key combination try to suspend to ram which freezes
  the machine completely.
* The ESS winmodem in XE3 (and other) machines is not working with Linux.
  There are binary only drivers but those have a lot of problems (eg. lock
  up the machine at disconnect etc.)

  Linux.
