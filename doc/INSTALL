Installation instructions for omnibook module on kernel series 2.6
==================================================================

 This file explains how to install omnibook module from its sources on 2.6
 series kernels.

Step 1

  You must have full configured source for the Linux kernel which you
  want to use for the omnibook module. Note that omnibook module is part
  of the kernel, so there is necessary to resolve all symbol dependencies
  between the used kernel and omnibook code. Partly installed kernels
  (for example from distributor makers) can be unuseable for this action.

  You need GNU make and C compiler (gcc).
  gcc version needs to be the same as the one the kernel was compiled with 
  (eg. gcc-4.0 for gcc-4.0 compiled kernel).

Step 2

  Run `make install' as the super-user. This will install omnibook.ko kernel
  module into modules directory of your currently running kernel
  (usually in /lib/modules/version_of_your_kernel).
  You may install and load the module with `make load' command. In this case
  you may skip Step 3.

Step 3

   Load the installed module with `modprobe omnibook' command. It will
   enables the OmniBook features on your machine.
   To unload module issue an `modprobe -r omnibook' command. It will disable
   the OmniBook features and unload the module.

Step 4 (optional)

   Add necessary module options to your /etc/modprobe.conf or in a file
   in /etc/modporbe.d/. E.g.: "options omnibook apmemu=1 dock=1 user=1"

Step 5 (optional)

   Edit your startup scripts (eg. /etc/rc.local, /etc/rc.modules or /etc/modules) 
   to load this module at boot time.

How to integrate omnibook module to kernel sources?
---------------------------------------------------
  
 Run in the directory where you previously extracted the omnibook module sources:
 
 `make kpatch KSRC="/patch/to/kernel/source"'

 Configure and compile your kernel as usual. If you use `make menuconfig', the 
 omnibook module config options are in 'Processor type and feature'.
