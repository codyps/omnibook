Additional notes using omnibook module on kernel 2.6
----------------------------------------------------

1. General support
------------------

Finally a working kernel 2.6 support solution was added to Makefile
(thanks to Mark Chappell <mark@nslm.fsnet.co.uk>). It permit to build,
install and load the omnibook module. Now the module unload is working
for 2.6 series kernels (thanks to math_b@users.sourceforge.net).

2. OneTouch buttons
-------------------

OneTouch buttons are enabled on most models by kernel series 2.5/2.6
at startup without this module, and someone asked me: Why have you need it
yet? Sometimes it is useful to disable them e.g. if you travel with your
laptop on train or plane, and want to prevent accidental pressing buttons
on front/side of your laptop.
