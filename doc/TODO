TODO
====

Current issues:

* See if/how key polling can be ported to 2.6
* LED API support
* Create a clean access method to the i8042 kbd controller (this will require
  a kernel patch)
* To be cleaned: battery dump fan_policy

Old items imported from previous version:

* Fix LCD brighness handling on XE3GF style machines
* Fully support OB5xx, OB6xxx and XE4500 style machines
* Battery support for OB5xx, OB6xxx and XE4500 style machines

Will probably remain here forever:

* Adding more features of embedded controller
* Support more machines
