hp's onetouch windows utility
-----------------------------

When installing hp's onetouch utility in Windows, you can find a ONETOUCH.CFG 
file in the installation folder which seems to contain EC Controller commands 
for some special features of the embedded controller (like mute led, etc..).

It looks like the Windows DLL that sends commands to the EC controller is 
LgKCUtl.DLL, also found in the onetouch installation folder. Maybe this is 
useful to somebody someday :)
